Product List View in JavaFX

Product List View developed using JavaFX, OOP, and CSS for style.
---------------------------

This interface provides us with several filters, such as the button to add, delete, save, exit, open and reset the product table.

Also the products can be sorted ascending or descending after each column.

Each content / cell in the table can be modified by clicking on the desired cell, then after changing with the desired data press the enter button to remain saved in the database.
