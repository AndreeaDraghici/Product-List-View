# Product-List-View

Product List View developed using JavaFX, OOP, and CSS for style.
---------------------------

This interface provides us with several filters, such as the button to add, delete, save, exit, open and reset the product table.

Also the products can be sorted ascending or descending after each column.

Each content / cell in the table can be modified by clicking on the desired cell, then after changing with the desired data press the enter button to remain saved in the database.

Other products can be added to the database, deleted, modified, saved, a new file can be opened and the database can be reset from the beginning.

At first the data is entered into the database directly from the program, using the get and set properties, then a new product can be added by the user

After each change made, a message will appear in the console confirming that the desired choice has been made successfully.

This is the first task in JavaFX.
